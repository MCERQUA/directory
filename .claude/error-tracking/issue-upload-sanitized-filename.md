Supabase POST failed: 400

  "code":"23502",
  "details":"Failing row contains (8, 1, Sample Construction Contract2.PDF, null, 97093, application/pdf, 1f8333a175b24db4bbcb066b261295c03d435c9762d7f6bec32e5424460bccf1, null, null, null, uploaded, null, null, null, null, null, null, f, f, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 2025-07-07 23:59:44.959048+00, 2025-07-07 23:59:44.959048+00, null).",
  "hint":null,
  "message":"null value in column \"sanitized_filename\" of relation \"contract_uploads\" violates not-null constraint"
}
```

### Reproduction Steps
1. Navigate to https://cca-coi-live.pages.dev/upload
2. Select a PDF file to upload
3. Click upload button
4. Error appears: sanitized_filename NULL constraint violation

### Environment
- **Component**: Backend - Cloudflare Worker / Supabase Integration
- **File(s) Affected**: workers-api.js (upload endpoint)
- **Dependencies**: Supabase PostgREST API

## Previous Attempts (from AI-ERROR-TRACKER.md)
- Multiple attempts to modify worker code
- PostgREST cache issues identified
- Attempted to use metadata tables as workaround
- Various code modifications failed due to circular dependencies

## Resolution Attempts

### Current Analysis - [2025-07-08 01:53]
**Hypothesis**: Worker is not setting sanitized_filename field when inserting to contract_uploads table
**Pre-Action Slack**: Posted to #cca-coi-updates-feed (3+ attempts alert)
**Actions to Take**:
1. Check current Supabase table schema
2. Verify worker code sanitized_filename generation
3. Apply fix directly to worker
4. Test and deploy
