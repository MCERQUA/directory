## Resolution History
**RESOLVED** - 2025-01-21T12:45:00Z

### Root Causes Identified:
1. **Supabase Timeout Too Short**: 8-second timeout was insufficient for database queries
2. **Missing Timeout Handling**: Some components lacked proper timeout configuration
3. **Google Maps API Warnings**: Deprecation warnings (non-blocking)

### Solutions Implemented:
1. **Extended Timeouts**: Increased from 8s to 30s across all data loading components
2. **Enhanced Supabase Client**: Added proper headers and configuration options
3. **Real Data Integration**: Updated contractors/map page to use Supabase instead of mock data only
4. **Proper Error Handling**: Added graceful fallback to mock data when needed
5. **TypeScript Fixes**: Resolved all compilation errors

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/popular-listing-two.tsx` - Extended timeout to 30s
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Enhanced client configuration
- `src/pages/listings/half-map/half-map-01.tsx` - Added real data integration with timeout
- `src/pages/listings/list-layout/list-layout-01.tsx` - Added proper timeout handling

### Verification:
- Direct Supabase connectivity test successful (2 contractor listings found)
- TypeScript compilation successful
- Build completed without errors
- All timeout handling properly implemented
