# /directory-setup

## Description
Executes the complete directory setup procedure, reviewing planning documents, checking current production status, and continuing incomplete tasks with progress tracking.

## Usage
```
/directory-setup
```

## Procedure Overview

### Phase 1: Planning Document Review
1. Read and analyze all planning documents in `/docs/`
2. Load current site structure and chosen page variants
3. Review implementation task list and priorities
4. Check setup tracking file for previous progress

### Phase 2: Production Status Assessment
1. Analyze current codebase structure
2. Check existing route configurations
3. Verify current page implementations
4. Identify gaps between plan and current state

### Phase 3: Task Execution
1. Load incomplete tasks from tracking file
2. Execute tasks in priority order
3. Update progress tracking after each task
4. Handle interruptions gracefully with state persistence

### Phase 4: Progress Tracking
1. Maintain detailed task completion status
2. Track file changes and implementations
3. Log any issues or blockers encountered
4. Provide session summary and next steps

## Setup Tracking System
- **File**: `/docs/setup-progress.json`
- **Purpose**: Persistent task tracking across sessions
- **Features**: Task status, timestamps, file changes, notes
- **Recovery**: Resume from last completed task

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Atomic Tasks**: Each task is self-contained and can be resumed
2. **State Persistence**: Progress saved after each completed task
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of interruptions
4. **Validation**: Verify task completion before marking as done
5. **Rollback**: Ability to undo changes if needed

## Task Categories
- **Core Pages**: Homepage and listing configurations
- **Authentication**: Login/register system setup
- **Dashboard**: User management interfaces
- **Static Pages**: About, contact, legal pages
- **Booking System**: Payment and scheduling flow
- **Navigation**: Menu and routing structure

## Session Management
- **Start**: Load planning docs and previous progress
- **Continue**: Resume from last incomplete task
- **Interrupt**: Save current state and provide resume instructions
- **Complete**: Generate final summary and next steps
